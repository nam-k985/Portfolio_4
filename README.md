### Task Overview
The task involves building and evaluating predictive models to assess factors influencing exam grades using a dataset containing personal, academic, and behavioral data of students. The primary objective is to train and test models that can predict exam outcomes based on a variety of features such as attendance, hours studied, teacher ratings, and previous scores.

### Data Used
The data includes both numerical and categorical variables, such as demographic details, academic performance indicators, and other factors like family income, attendance records, and study habits, providing a holistic view of each studentâ€™s profile.

### Algorithms Applied
The algorithms applied include logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and also feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). 

### Deployment/Execution
The file can be run in Python using Jupyter notebooks, after ensuring that all required libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib are installed.

### Key Takeaways
Key takeaways include the importance of attendance and study habits as significant factors influencing exam performance, and the ability of these models to inform targeted interventions.
